# Multi Agent Reinforcment Learning Project:
#### By Adam Lagssaibi, Edgard Dabier and Nolan Sisouphanthong

In this repository, we will explore various RL methods (**single agent** algorithms to learn the best policy, as well as more complex **multi agents** algorithms)

The file `single_agent_env.py` contains the basic code to load an environment, find the best policy using a **Value Iteration** algorithm and then simulate the best policy to visualize it.

Then the `multi-agent-FrozenLake.ipynb` file implements a custom 2-agents version of open AI's FrozenLake game. It includes a Central Q Learning algortihm as well as a visual render of the game.
